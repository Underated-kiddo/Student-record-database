# Student Record Database

## Description
This project is a SQL-based solution for managing student records. It includes a set of SQL queries and commands stored in the `answers.sql` file, which can be used to create, manage, and query a student database. The project is designed to help users efficiently handle student data for academic or administrative purposes.

## How to Access the Project from GitHub
1. Visit the GitHub repository URL where this project is hosted.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

## How to Run/Setup the Project
1. Ensure you have a SQL database management system installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite).
2. Open your database management tool or command-line interface.
3. Import the `answers.sql` file into your database by running the following command:
   ```
   SOURCE path/to/answers.sql;
   ```
   Replace `path/to/answers.sql` with the actual path to the `answers.sql` file.
4. Execute the queries as needed to interact with the student database.

## How to Use the Project
1. After importing the `answers.sql` file, you can run SQL queries to:
   - Create tables for storing student records.
   - Insert, update, or delete student data.
   - Query the database to retrieve specific information.
2. Modify the SQL queries in the `answers.sql` file as needed to suit your requirements.
